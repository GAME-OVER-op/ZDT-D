# Version 1.6.9  
**Stable Release**

## What's New

- Added additional optimizations and refined service start conditions.
- Fixed an issue where OperaVPN would start with an empty application list — OperaVPN no longer starts without a valid list.
- Fixed dnscrypt starting while the module was stopped — components now start only when the module is running.
- Improved update-info retrieval performance and reliability.
- Enhanced battery-saving logic and service management.
- Fixed a T2S bug that could cause high CPU load due to excessive intermediary requests.
- General logic improvements and performance optimizations.

**Note:** It is recommended to restart the device after installation so updated services and rules initialize correctly.
